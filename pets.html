            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Pluto</h2>
            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width = "400" alt="Dog with long white hair looks like it's smiling with an underbite">
            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
            <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.</p>

            <h2>Juno</h2>
            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width = "400" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side">
            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <p>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.</p>

            <h2>Luna the Goona</h2>
            <img src="images/luna.JPG" width = "400" alt="A white and gray dog with wide, blue eyes looks at camera with mouth open">
            <p>Luna is a 9 year old dog who was rescued from a breeding/hoarding situation when she was 6 years old. She has extreme PTSD but has made incredible progress since she's joined the family.</p>
            <p>A lot of people would say that they have the most special dog in the world, but with Luna I think it's actually true. Someone once came up to me and asked if I adopted her because she's ugly and no one else would adopt her. I think she's the most gorgeous goon I've ever seen.</p>

            <h2>Snoopy</h2>
            <img src="images/snoopy_happy.JPG" width = "400" alt="A black and white cat lays on a bed with its eyes closed">
            <p>We adopted Snoopy from the shelter about a month ago, and they told us he's about one year old. He definetly has kitten energy and is always bouncing off the walls and playing with his two sisters.</p>
            <p>The shelter told us he could see out of his left eye, but the vet that we took him to said he most likely can't, which explains why he's so clumsy and bad at jumping up onto things.</p>
